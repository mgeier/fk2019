Dynamic 3D Audio Scenes with ASDF + SSR
=======================================

Slides for my "Forschungskolloquium" at
[FG Audiokommunikation](https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/), TU Berlin.

Date: 2019-11-19

See https://www.ak.tu-berlin.de/menue/lehre/wintersemester_201920/forschungskolloquium/ for details.

Abstract
--------

Presentation of an open-source software for real-time spatial audio reproduction
called *SoundScape Renderer* (SSR).
Review of available reproduction methods, focussing on binaural rendering and
Wave Field Synthesis (WFS).
Discussion of ongoing work, e.g. extension to 3D (only binaural renderer for now)
and a browser-based 3D GUI.

Presentation of the *Audio Scene Description Format* (ASDF), a format for
dynamic audio scenes which is currently under development.
It allows for moving sources along pre-defined 3D trajectories.
Open questions and future work will be discussed.

Time permitting, there will be a demonstration of the SSR running on a
loudspeaker array in one of the studios @ FG Audiokommunikation.
